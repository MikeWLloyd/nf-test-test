# Test Data

This directory contains 10,000 simulated RNA, whole exome, whole genome, and ATAC-seq paired end reads based on GRCm38 (mm10) and GRCh38 (hg38).  

These files can be used in testing pipeline functionality. 

Sample chip-seq data from NF-core are provided. These data can be staged by the workflow from the provided URLs. 

A sample CSV datasheet are provided for PTA. 

A sample WES datasheet for both remote and local files is provided for testing download and/or local samplesheet input to workflows.
